IMPLEMENTATIONS:

The creation of feature sets can be found in 'features.py'

We implemented a perceptron and a fully-connected neural network from scratch. These classifiers are in the file 'basic_classifiers.py'

We also implemented a convolutional neural net using Theano in files 'theano_convnet.py', 'theano_classifier.py', and 'theano_utils.py'
